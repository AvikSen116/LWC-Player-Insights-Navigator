# LWC Player Insights & Navigator



## Problem Statement

The sports industry relies heavily on detailed player data and quick access to player profiles for scouting, analysis, and decision-making. However, navigating and filtering player information efficiently across different regions, such as Indian ,British ,Australian etc players, is often cumbersome and time-consuming. Existing solutions lack intuitive navigation and a unified platform that provides both quick access and in-depth insights into player profiles.


### Project Overview:
 

LWC Player Insights & Navigator is a Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) project designed to simplify the navigation and exploration of player profiles. This project aims to offer an intuitive and interactive user experience by allowing users to filter players based on regions and access detailed insights about each player through dynamic and responsive components.

  
           
### Key Features:

    a) Interactive Player Cards: Display player information using visually appealing cards that offer quick navigation and insights at a glance.

    b) Filtering Functionality: Search and filter players by categories such as nationality (e.g., Indian, British), enabling users to find specific player profiles quickly.

    c) Dynamic Player Insights: On selecting a player card, detailed information, including a picture, stats, and background, is displayed to the right, enhancing the analysis process.

    d) Custom Navigation and Search: Integrated buttons and navigation functionalities allow seamless movement between different player profiles.

    e) Responsive Design with Lightning Layouts: Utilizes lightning-layout to create a responsive and user-friendly interface that adapts to various screen sizes.
    
    f) Combobox with sObject Picklist Values: Fetches and displays relevant data using picklist values, making data input and selection intuitive.

    g) Advanced Parent-Child Communication: Implements robust communication between components using public properties, methods, and custom events for smooth data transfer, developed with VS Code.

    h) Lightning Message Service (LMS): Employs LMS for communication between unrelated components, enhancing the modularity and maintainability of the application.

    i)Dynamic Styling with CSS: Custom styling applied to enhance the visual appeal and provide a consistent look and feel across the application.

### Technical Highlights:


1) Use of template.querySelector to interact with DOM elements.

2) Implementation of @api decorator for public properties and methods.

3) Custom events for parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication.

4) Application of Lightning Message Channels for unrelated component interaction.
